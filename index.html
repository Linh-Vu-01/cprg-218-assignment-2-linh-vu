                Hey there, I'm Linh - an aspiring photographer and creative graphic designer based in Calgary, Canada. At the beginning of this year, I returned to my home country and traveled across Vietnam with my family, capturing our adventures through photography. This experience is an essential part of my journal, which focuses on landscapes, people, and the details of everyday life. Now, I'm embarking on a new journey in Calgary, where I'll continue to hone my skills and pursue my passion for art, design, and photography.
